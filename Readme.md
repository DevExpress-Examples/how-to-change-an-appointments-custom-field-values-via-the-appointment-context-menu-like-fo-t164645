# How to change an appointment's custom field values via the "Appointment" context menu (like for labels and statuses)


<p>This example demonstrates how you can add possible values of an appointmen's custom field as additional items into the appointment's context menu, so that an end-user can change the appointmen's custom filed value in a similar manner as for labels and statuses.<br />The checked state of these additional items is synchronized with an appointment's custom field value in the client-side ASPxMenu.Popup event handler.<br />The appointment's custom field value is changed on the ASPxScheduler's custom callback after an end-user clicks a corresponding menu item. </p>
